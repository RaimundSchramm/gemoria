## gemoria [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RaimundSchramm/gemoria.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RaimundSchramm/gemoria)

everything that comes to mind

### About
This project started as a simple ToDo-app inspired by [this great Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery-ajax-revised).

Quickly it became my favourite tool to guide my agile software development practice.

As a replacement for a fully-featured traditional ticket system like Redmine, scrum tool like PivotalTracker or even the issues and wiki here on github it should focus on the task at hand and add features as needed.

In its current state it is for use as a very simple scrum tool and comparable to PivotalTracker but not near as complex.
